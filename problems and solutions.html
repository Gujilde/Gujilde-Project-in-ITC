                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>There are things that my product cannot do and repair just because its size is too small since it was easy to handle.</li>
                    <li>This multi-tool has lesser tools compared to other modern multi-tools nowadays.</li>
                    <li>My product is not quietly unique and there's no possibility that it will become a trend because most people today are more curious and attracted to the technologies that are more advanced. </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>On Web Page</h3>
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>It is hard to create a digital sketch for my product because I haven't had any foundation on computers yet as well as my editing skills.</li>
                    <li>There are hover effects things that I cannot do to my website even I double-check the code that I followed from watching on Youtube.</li>
                    <li>As I noticed that as long as I making this website, the background image and the text of my web page are moving on every page I clicked based on my observation.</li>
