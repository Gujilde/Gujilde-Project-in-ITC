                <h3>To my Product</h3> 
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>I already know from the start that my product has nothing specials compared to other multi tools products aside from having an additional feautures which is lighter and LED light but this tool is very important to the people who loves Camping and Hiking.They oftenly use this especially at night, the lighter use for creating a bonfire and for grilling while the LED light use for finding things even to the people incase are missing during that night. Lastly, do not forget the other basic tools that are commonly find to other multi-tools also including a saw, scissor and knife for cutting solid things, flat and philips screwdriver used for adjusting the screws from machines and also the can opener as speaks the purpose of it.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <h3>On Web Page</h3>
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Since it was hard to create a digital sketch for my product so I decided to create a simple sketch on draw.io, an app where we usually create a flowchart the requires in our FOP subject which you have already seen on the details page that labeled the parts of my improvise product.</li>
                    <li>There are hover effects things that is not working to my web page even I double-check the code that I followed from watching on Youtube so what I did is I make my web page look simple and clean.</li>
                    <li>As I noticed that as long as I making this webpage, the background image and the text of my web page are moving on every page I clicked based on my observation. The solution is quite simple, I adjusted the height, width, margin, etc. that could suit the format from the other correct pages even it goes to the point that it can able to scroll and I don't worry about that because on User Acceptable Level page will be having a long page that can able to scroll too long since the requirement of this Web page is 10 pages only</li>
